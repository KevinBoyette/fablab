# Getting Started with the Examples

`fablab` includes several pre-built models, which we will explore in this guide.

The `zitilib/examples/tiny` model and the `zitilib/examples/smartrouting` model, both implement operational Ziti fabric overlays, perform fabric-native operational testing using the `loop2` tool, and provide data sets about mesh configuration and performance metrics.
